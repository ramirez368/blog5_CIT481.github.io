## What Is Chef?
Chef is an automation tool that provides a way to define infrastructure as code. Infrastructure as code (IAC) simply means that managing infrastructure by writing code (Automating infrastructure) rather than using manual processes. It can also be termed as programmable infrastructure. Chef uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configurations. Below are the types of automation done by Chef, irrespective of the size of infrastructure:

* Infrastructure configuration
* Application deployment 
* Configurations are managed across your network

In Chef, Nodes are dynamically updated with the configurations in the Server. This is called Pull Configuration which means that we don’t need to execute even a single command on the Chef server to push the configuration on the nodes, nodes will automatically update themselves with the configurations present in the Server. My next blog on Chef Tutorial will explain the Chef architecture along with all the Chef components in detail.

Now, let us look at reasons behind the popularity of Chef.

## Chef Key Metrics

* Chef supports multiple platforms like AIX, RHEL/CentOS, FreeBSD, OS X, Solaris, Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu. Additional client platforms include Arch Linux, Debian and Fedora.
* Chef can be integrated with cloud-based platforms such as Internap, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack, SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace to automatically provision and configure new machines.
* Chef has an active, smart and fast growing community support.
* Because of Chef’s maturity and flexibility, it is being used by giants like Mozilla, Expedia, Facebook, HP Public Cloud, Prezi, Xero, Ancestry.com, Rackspace, Get Satisfaction, IGN, Marshall University, Socrata, University of Minnesota, Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Bonobos, Splunk, Citi, DueDil, Disney, and Cheezburger.
